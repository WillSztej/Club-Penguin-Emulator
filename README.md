# Club-Penguin-Emulator
Web service that emulates similar functionality of Club Penguin

I grew up loving MMOs, with Club Penguin being one of my personal favorites. CP is an interesting MMO because it was
a browser-based application as opposed to natively downloaded like Wizard101, ToonTown, or Pirates Online.

I am interested in building a similar browser app the replicates the core functionality of Club Penguin. A website in which
you can connect with friends in a virtual web environment. I would like to use reference to CP client source code that is in
public domain while also try to reverse engineer backend functionality (since the servers hosted by Disney are now shut down
and obviously have no public access).
